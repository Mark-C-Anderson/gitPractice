# <ins>The gitPractice Git Course</ins>

This GitLab repository is a safe environment for you to make sure you can use Git. 
Think of this repository as a sort of 'Graduation'
from your initial Git learning. If you can complete the tasks outlined in this
document then you are good to go!

## Resources For You
* You can learn how to do all of the tasks below in the 
[So, You Want to Use Git?](https://github.com/Mark-C-Anderson/So-You-Want-To-Use-Git) 
manual. This is a completely free document designed to help the absolute
beginner learn how to use Git, complete with lots of screenshots and detailed
explanations.

## The Basics

1. Make a fork of this repository, then clone it to your computer. Do this by 
pressing the `Fork` button above.
2. Add a new file to the repository in the `src/` folder.
3. Stage, commit, and push your changes to this online repository.

## Editing Files

1. Take any of the files and open it on your computer.
2. Add something to the file, and delete something else.
3. Stage, commit, and push your changes.
4. Add something else to the file, and then delete another something else.
5. Stage, commit, and push your changes.

## Looking at Differences Between Files

1. Using either your computer or this website, look at the differences between
the two commits that you made in the [Editing Files](#Editing Files) section above.
2. Now look at the differences between two commits that someone else made before
you.

## Branching and Merging

1. Create a branch off of `master`. Call it anything you want.
2. Make three changes to the repository while within your branch.
3. Return to the master branch, verify that your changes did not affect the master
branch.
4. Create a `merge request`. Approve the merge request yourself. (In general,
you'll make a merge request and then wait for someone else to 
approve it, but you can do it all yourself here.)
5. Delete your branch.

## Resolving Merge Conflicts

1. Create another branch off of `master`.
2. Make three changes to one of the files in the repository while within your branch.
3. Return to the master branch, and make a change that directly conflicts with just one
the changes that you made in your branch (ie. change the same line(s) of the same file
to say different things).
4. Create a `merge request`. Verify that there is indeed a conflict.
5. Resolve the conflict by accepting the master branch's change instead of the one
from your branch.
6. Merge the rest of the changes from your branch into the master branch.
7. Delete your branch.

1. Add yourself to this list below, along with your affiliation. To do this, 
open the `README.md` file and edit it. The '.md' stands for `markdown`, and it's a
way to write nicely-formatted text documents like this one. You'll need to use
markdown to write README.md files for your own Git Repositories in the future.
